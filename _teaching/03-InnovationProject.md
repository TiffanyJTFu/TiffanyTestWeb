<br><br>**Project Background**
At SHAD, my team and I tackled a problem every Canadian driver knows too well: winter roads. Canada sees about 160,000 crashes a year, and roughly 30% are tied to winter conditions. Our question was simple: how can we warn drivers about black ice in real time-without waiting years for new road infrastructure?

We built ICELERT: a small, vehicle-mounted thermal sensor that scans the pavement ~30 meters ahead and flags dangerous surface conditions in a paired mobile app to help and connect people to be wary of dangerous roads especially in unpredictable weather like black ice. I led the market research and feasibility work-referencing already existing tools and technologies, connecting and listening to commuters, and translating their needs into clear requirements for our device: early warning, easy install, and an approachable price. Across the process, we gathered input from 100+ people across Canada to shape features and UX, and we worked with two U of T civil engineering professors who advised us on feasibility, testing conditions, and deployment constraints.

From there, we designed and modeled the core components of our device (thermal camera, microcontroller, protective housing), designed the device and enclosure, and developed product-packaging concepts for marketing and retail. We mapped and produced both a 3D-modeled hardware prototype (for mounting/enclosure design) and an online app/UX prototype. We also outlined a concrete testing plan-cold-room testing followed by on-road trials along with AI training for our devices.

On the business side, we created a financial plan demonstrating our costs, profits, etc. Our financial plan includes a target of ~$350 build cost and a ~$500 price, with break-even around 440 units. We also identified and researched our first users/ target markets (working commuters 20-65), mapped channels (car company partners, e-commerce, retail auto shops), and created a marketing plan of VR demos so people could “see” hazard detection in action and test out our AI models for us to gather live data. We presented a 20 minute live pitch to industry professionals-top professors, engineers in this space, and actual investors-and folded their feedback into our next steps. In the end, we delivered a one-page pitch, a five-page report, a financial model, a product video, an app UX, and both the 3D-modeled and online prototypes. ICELERT turns winter safety from reactive to proactive-data-driven, affordable, and deployable now tool for the safety of Canadians.

**PROBLEM**
<br>Heat generating car in some way
* **Stakeholders + Aspects**
<br>Those in the working industry that need to drive large distances
  * Truck Transporters: job requires hours on the road, and the faster they are able to travel faster clients 
  * Office workers: office workers need to wake up earlier to arrive to their workplaces on time
* **Government Methods of Mitigation**
  * Snow removal and de-icing: Municipal snow clearing programs ensure roads and sidewalks and bike lanes are plowed quickly after the snow falls - this is an issue because sometimes, these programs do not act quickly enough to be effective, causing people to be delayed in moving from place to place (eg. important meetings - Gideon’s example)
   * Salt/Sand/Brine treatments - Salt on roads is detrimental to transportation methods’ stability as it causes corrosion which impacts both vehicle and infrastructure integrity
   * Use of Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS) to monitor pavement temperatures, humidity and precipitation - has limited coverage and placement; maintenance and reliability issues; Lack of real-time responsiveness; Requires integration with other systems; high cost solution
   * Anti-icing methods done pre-snowfall to reduce accumulation and make plowing more efficient - timing is critical; weather condition uncertainty

<br>**STATS**
* In November 2021, when the Fraser valley and Sumas Prairie in British Columbia’s Lower mainland were overwhelmed by massive flooding. Metro Vancouver was cut off from the rest of Canada by road. Nothing could leave the port of Vancouver, massively impacting the supply chain, prairie farmers, manufactures, and many other businesses.
* About 18% of fatal collisions occurred during poor weather conditions in Canada in 2021
* About 30% of accidents occurred on wet, icy, or snowy roads, with about one-third of all accidents in Canada
* 29% of collisions were caused by environmental factors (unlisted)
* ~30% of Canadian collisions were caused by wet roads, snow or ice. (chatgpt)
* 1/3 of car collisions happen in winter in Canada (chatgpt)
* Approximately 30% of reported collisions happen on wet, snowy, or icy roads.
* According to Natural Resources Canada, fuel consumption can increase by approximately 1.3% on highways due to increased wind resistance alone.
* Colder temperatures can reduce fuel efficiency by 12-28% on urban commutes.
* Collisions drastically increase energy usage in vehicles because the kinetic energy of the cars is converted into other forms of energy during the impact, primarily heat and sound, and also through deformation of the vehicle's structure.
* Collisions are more prominent during winter in Canada due to hazardous road conditions, reduced visibility, and increased travel during the holiday season. Icy roads, especially black ice, and snowy conditions reduce tire traction, making it harder to stop or steer safely. Reduced daylight hours and inclement weather, like heavy snowfall, also impair visibility, making it challenging for drivers to react to hazards.
* In 2017, nearly 30 percent of collisions reported to the National Collision Database happened on wet, snowy or icy roads. One third happened in January, February, November and December
* Victoria, British Columbia, is generally considered the Canadian city with the least amount of snowfall and 232 reported incidents while Edmonton is generally one of the most snowfall 24,003 motor vehicle collisions in Edmonton

<br>**STEPS**
* Identify Weather-Related Hazards
  * Analyze collision data to determine which weather conditions (e.g. snow, freezing rain, fog, heavy rain) cause most accidents.
  * Map high-risk areas (intersections, highways, rural roads) with frequent weather-related incidents.
* Improve Road Maintenance and Response
  * Increase frequency and coverage of salting and plowing during snow or freezing rain.
  * Deploy real-time weather monitoring stations to inform rapid deployment of maintenance crews.
  * Implement brine pre-treatment strategies before snowfall or freezing rain to reduce ice formation.
* Enhance Driver Awareness and Communication
  * Use digital highway signs to display real-time weather and hazard warnings.
  * Integrate weather alerts with navigation apps  and local radio to inform drivers promptly.
  * Conduct seasonal public education campaigns on driving behaviour in specific weather conditions.
* Upgrade Road Infrastructure
  * Improve drainage systems to prevent pooling during heavy rain.
  * Install heated pavement technology or road surface treatments in critical zones to reduce ice build-up.
  * Enhance street lighting and reflective lane markings for reduced-visibility conditions like fog and heavy rain.
* Enforce Appropriate Speed and Safety Regulations
  * Implement variable speed limits adjusted to weather conditions using digital signs.
  * Increase penalties for reckless driving during hazardous weather.
  * Deploy more police patrols or automated enforcement in areas with high weather-related collision rates.
* Promote Vehicle Safety Standards
  * Encourage use of winter tires through rebates or mandatory regulations in winter months.
  * Promote regular vehicle checks (tire tread depth, windshield wipers, brake efficiency) before winter.
* Monitor, Evaluate, and Adapt
  * Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of interventions using accident and response data.
  * Adjust policies, resource allocation, and infrastructure planning based on evaluation results

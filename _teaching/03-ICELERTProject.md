<br><br>**PROJECT BACKGROUND**
<br>At **SHAD**, my team and I tackled a problem every **Canadian driver** knows too well: **winter roads**. Canada sees about **160,000 crashes a year**, and roughly **30%** are tied to winter conditions. Our question was simple: how can we **warn drivers about black ice in real time**—without waiting years for new road infrastructure?

We built **ICELERT**: a small, **vehicle-mounted thermal sensor** that scans the pavement ~30 meters ahead and flags dangerous surface conditions in a paired **mobile app** to help and connect people to be wary of **dangerous roads** especially in unpredictable weather like black ice. I led the **market research** and **feasibility work**—referencing already existing tools and technologies, connecting and listening to **commuters**, and translating their needs into clear requirements for our device: early warning, easy install, and an approachable price. Across the process, we gathered input from **100+ people across Canada** to shape **features and UX**, and we worked with three **U of T civil engineering professors** who advised us on feasibility, testing conditions, and deployment constraints.

From there, we designed and modeled the **core components** of our device (**thermal camera, microcontroller, protective housing**), designed the device and enclosure, and developed product-packaging concepts for marketing and retail. We mapped and produced both a **3D-modeled hardware prototype** (for mounting/enclosure design) and an **online app/UX prototype**. We also outlined a **concrete testing plan**—cold-room testing followed by **on-road trials** along with **AI training** for our devices.

On the **business side**, we created a **financial plan** demonstrating our costs, profits, etc. Our financial plan includes a target of ~$350 build cost and a ~$500 price, with break-even around 440 units. We also identified and researched our first users / target markets (working commuters 20–65), mapped channels (car company partners, e-commerce, retail auto shops), and created a **marketing plan** of **VR demos** so people could “see” **hazard detection** in action and test out our **AI models** to gather **live data**. We presented a 20-minute live pitch to industry professionals—top professors, engineers, and actual investors—and folded their feedback into our next steps. In the end, we delivered a one-page pitch, a **five-page report**, a **financial model**, a **product video**, an **app UX**, and both the **3D-modeled** and **online prototypes**. **ICELERT** turns winter safety from reactive to proactive, data-driven, affordable, and deployable now tool for the safety of Canadians.

**PROJECT DETAILS**
* Collaborated with a team of 6 members to **innovate** and solve a **Canadian transportation issue**.
* Identified and researched a real **safety gap** by surveying **100+ commuters across Canada** about winter driving and black ice.
* Led **market research** and **analyzing market opportunities**, referencing existing tools and technology, interviewing commuters, and translating findings into clear requirements (early warning, easy install, affordable price) for our device.
* Led the design of **ICELERT**, a small **car-mounted thermal sensor + app** that warns drivers about icy roads ~30 m ahead.
* Proposed and designed **key core components** of our device (**thermal camera, microcontroller, enclosure, packaging**) and collaborated with other members to model a **3D prototype** for mounting and durability.
* Built an **online app/UX prototype** and outlined **signal-processing logic** for detecting dangerous surface conditions.
* Collaborated and contacted/connected with two **UofT civil engineering professors** to check feasibility, testing conditions, and deployment constraints as well as gain more insight and research on our issue and potential setbacks.
* Presented the project to **industry engineers, professors, and investors** and integrated their feedback into the project’s next steps.
* Developed a **product testing plan** (**cold-room tests → on-road trials + AI training and development plans**) to confirm performance in real conditions.
* Planned and researched **go-to-market** and **marketing strategies**: **Target Market** (working commuters 20–65), **channels** (car manufacturing partners, e-commerce, auto shops), and proposed **VR demos** for **AI data training** and **mass marketing**.
* Produced **deliverables**: one-page pitch, 5-page report, financial model, product video, app UX, and packaging concepts.
* Strengthened skills in **user research, 3D modeling, basic product designing, budgeting, pitching, and team leadership**.

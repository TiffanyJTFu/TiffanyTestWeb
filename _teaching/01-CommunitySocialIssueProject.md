<br><br>**Project Background**
<br>At Brown’s Leadership & Social Change program, I focused on a problem I felt close to: a spike in anti-Asian bias and how little many peers knew about Asian cultures. I didn’t want another abstract paper; I wanted a plan people could use. With guidance from a Brown mentor, I did independent research—researching about the rising anti-Asian racism and reviewing possible school-based interventions and communicating informally with classmates and teachers about what they were seeing. The pattern was clear: misinformation, shallow representation, and few structured chances for positive contact with my culture. From that analysis, I built a ready-to-launch action plan.

It outlines a semester of low-cost, high-engagement modules—callBrown University Pre-college leadership program - Social change and leadership - community social issue projectigraphy and other realistic and fun workshops, foodways and language mini-lessons—paired with outreach scripts for social media, and reflection prompts for improvements. To make the case, I produced an impact presentation video; to make it actionable, I also wrote an implementation report with budget templates, roles, timelines, and risk-mitigation steps for sustainability. I left with tangible tools and a concrete feasible plan that any student team can adopt immediately. This project matters to me because it turns such a large social issue into structured learning opportunities. It offers anyone a practical, replicable path schools and communities can use to reduce bias and strengthen cross-cultural understanding of not just my culture but all cultures as well. 

**Project Details**
* Investigated anti-Asian hate as a case study and interacted with students/teachers to surface system gaps not just in asian hate, but systematic multi-culturalism issues as well—misinformation, one-note representation, and too few structured chances to connect across cultures.
* Designed a launch-ready semester plan that starts with Asian cultural modules and scales to other cultures—hands-on calligraphy/knot-tying, foodways, language micro-lessons, and storytelling circles to build real cross-cultural contact.
* Engineered a plug-and-play toolkit (lesson outlines, outreach scripts, reflection prompts) so any student team can run inclusive programming immediately and adapt it for multiple cultures.
* Produced an impact video and authored an implementation guide (budgets, roles, timeline, simple risk checks) to make rollout painless and sustainable.
* Packaged and prepared for future rollout by me or other clubs; positioned to reduce bias and advance multicultural representation; not yet deployed. 
* Planning to reach out to 1000 schools across Canada to help implement this project. 
    
**Action Plan**
<br>To address the ongoing issue of anti-Asian discrimination and the misrepresentation of Chinese culture, this action plan proposes the creation of a Chinese Cultural Club at school. The goal is to foster a safe, inclusive, and engaging space where students can explore, share, and celebrate Chinese heritage through hands-on cultural activities such as calligraphy, traditional crafts, and storytelling.

The club aims to raise awareness, strengthen cultural identity, and promote understanding among peers. With a strong foundation in school—supported by executive members, a teacher advisor, and a strategic social media presence—the club is designed to grow sustainably. Fundraising through events and online engagement will help support the club's operations.

Short-term goals include successfully running the club for at least one semester and gathering feedback for continuous improvement. Long-term goals involve expanding the initiative beyond the school by partnering with organizations like the Asian Solidarity Fund, with the ultimate vision of transforming the club into a youth-led non-profit that combats Asian hate and promotes cultural representation across the broader community.

By combining personal experience, leadership, and cultural knowledge, this plan seeks to create lasting change through education, representation, and community engagement.
<br><br>**Evaluation**
<br>The success of this initiative will be measured by the club’s ability to promote cultural appreciation, foster inclusivity, and challenge stereotypes surrounding Chinese culture. The club aims to serve as a welcoming space where students can celebrate cultural identity, share experiences, and engage in meaningful activities.

Evaluation will focus on both quantitative and qualitative metrics:
* Growth and engagement of club membership
* Fundraising efforts in support of anti-Asian hate awareness
* Member satisfaction and cultural impact, assessed through regular feedback surveys
* Semi-annual debrief sessions with executive members to reflect on progress and improve programming

A six-month review will be used as the first major checkpoint to assess outcomes against established goals. Key performance indicators will include membership numbers, event participation, and funds raised. Success will be defined by achieving (or approaching) these targets while creating a positive, culturally empowering environment for all involved.
<br><br>**Self-Reflection**
<br>Developing this action plan was both a meaningful and personal journey. Motivated by firsthand experiences of discrimination, I approached this project with strong determination and a deep sense of purpose. While the process was more detailed and demanding than expected, it pushed me to think critically and plan thoroughly—skills I had not fully exercised before at this level.

The greatest challenge was adapting to the level of depth required in planning, but it ultimately became one of the most rewarding aspects. Completing the plan gave me a strong sense of accomplishment and reaffirmed my commitment to making a positive impact. This experience not only strengthened my leadership and planning abilities, but also reinforced my belief in the importance of cultural representation and youth-driven change.

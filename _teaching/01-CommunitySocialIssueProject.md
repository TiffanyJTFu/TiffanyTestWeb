<br><br>**PROJECT BACKGROUND**
<br>At **Brown’s Leadership & Social Change program**, I focused on a problem I felt close to: a spike in **anti-Asian bias** and how little many peers knew about **Asian cultures**. I didn’t want another **abstract paper**; I wanted a **plan** people could use. With guidance from a **Brown mentor**, I did **independent research**—researching about the rising **anti-Asian racism** and reviewing possible **school-based interventions** and communicating informally with **classmates** and **teachers** about what they were seeing. The pattern was clear: **misinformation, shallow representation**, and few **structured chances** for **positive contact** with my **culture**. From that analysis, I built a **ready-to-launch action plan**.

It outlines a **semester** of **low-cost, high-engagement modules**—**calligraphy** and other **realistic and fun workshops**, **foodways** and **language mini-lessons**—paired with **outreach scripts** for **social media**, and **reflection prompts** for **improvements**. To make the case, I produced an **impact presentation video**; to make it actionable, I also wrote an **implementation report** with **budget templates, roles, timelines**, and **risk-mitigation steps** for **sustainability**. I left with **tangible tools** and a **concrete feasible plan** that any **student team** can adopt immediately. This project matters to me because it turns such a **large social issue** into **structured learning opportunities**. It offers anyone a **practical, replicable path** **schools** and **communities** can use to **reduce bias** and strengthen **cross-cultural understanding** of not just my **culture** but all **cultures** as well.

**PROJECT DETAILS**
* Investigated **anti-Asian hate** as a **case study** and interacted with **students/teachers** to surface **system gaps** not just in **Asian hate**, but **systematic multi-culturalism issues** as well—**misinformation, one-note representation**, and too few **structured chances** to **connect across cultures**.
* Designed a **launch-ready semester plan** that starts with **Asian cultural modules** and scales to **other cultures**—hands-on **calligraphy/knot-tying, foodways, language micro-lessons**, and **storytelling circles** to build real **cross-cultural contact**.
* Engineered a **plug-and-play toolkit** (**lesson outlines, outreach scripts, reflection prompts**) so any **student team** can run **inclusive programming** immediately and adapt it for **multiple cultures**.
* Produced an **impact video** and authored an **implementation guide** (**budgets, roles, timeline, simple risk checks**) to make **rollout painless** and **sustainable**.
* Packaged and prepared for **future rollout** by me or other **clubs**; positioned to **reduce bias** and advance **multicultural representation**; not yet **deployed**.

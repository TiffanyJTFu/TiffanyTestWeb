<br><br>**PROJECT BACKGROUND**
<br>At **Brown’s Leadership & Social Change program**, I focused on a problem I felt close to: a spike in **anti-Asian bias** and how little many peers knew about **Asian cultures**. I didn’t want another abstract paper; I wanted a **plan** people could use. With guidance from a **Brown mentor**, I did **independent research**—researching about the rising anti-Asian racism and reviewing possible school-based interventions and communicating informally with classmates and teachers about what they were seeing. The pattern was clear: misinformation, shallow representation, and few structured chances for positive contact with my culture. From that analysis, I built a **ready-to-launch action plan**.

It outlines a **semester** of **low-cost, high-engagement modules**—calligraphy and other realistic and fun workshops, foodways and language mini-lessons—paired with outreach scripts for social media, and reflection prompts for improvements. To make the case, I produced an **impact presentation video**; to make it actionable, I also wrote an **implementation report** with **budget templates, roles, timelines**, and **risk-mitigation steps** for sustainability. I left with **tangible tools** and a **concrete feasible plan** that any student team can adopt immediately. This project matters to me because it turns such a **large social issue** into **structured learning opportunities**. It offers anyone a practical, replicable path schools and communities can use to reduce bias and strengthen **cross-cultural understanding** of not just my culture but all cultures as well.

**PROJECT DETAILS**
* Investigated **anti-Asian hate** as a case study and engaged with students and teachers to uncover systemic gaps—not only in anti-Asian bias but in broader **multicultural inclusion** issues such as misinformation, one-dimensional representation, and limited structured opportunities for cross-cultural connection.
* **Building a plug-and-play toolkit and implementation guide** with lesson outlines, outreach scripts, reflection prompts, and timelines for easy adoption and adaptation across multiple cultures.
* Developed a **launch-ready semester plan** featuring **hands-on workshops, micro language lessons, and reflection circles** to promote meaningful cross-cultural engagement and understanding.
* Engineering materials that enable **any student team to run inclusive programming immediately**, with built-in flexibility for different cultural focuses (e.g., Asian traditions, foodways, and crafts such as calligraphy and knot-tying).
* Produced an **impact video** and authored an **implementation guide** (including budgets, roles, timelines, and simple risk checks) to support **sustainable, low-barrier rollout**.
* Packaged and prepared for future deployment by me or other student organizations—**positioned to reduce bias and advance multicultural representation**; rollout **pending**.

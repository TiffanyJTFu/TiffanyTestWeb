<br><br>**PROJECT BACKGROUND**
<br>In the context of **globalization**, increasing attention has been paid to the relationship between the **educational practices** of **immigrant families** and the **physical and mental health** of **adolescents**. Young people from immigrant backgrounds face unique challenges such as **cultural conflict, identity issues**, and the pressure to adapt to a new environment. These stressors can have significant impacts on their well-being, with reported cases of **depression** and even **suicide**. At the same time, **immigrant parents** also face difficulties in navigating parenting and supporting their children in a new **cultural and social context**.

These pressures should not be borne by individual families alone—they are **societal challenges** that require collective awareness and support.

To address this need, Leading Tomorrow, a non-profit organization, has launched a **social research project** titled “**Cross-cultural Education Methods and Adolescents’ Physical and Mental Health**.” The project aims to deepen understanding of how parenting and education styles within immigrant families affect **adolescents’ mental health** and **social adaptability**. By conducting this **research**, the project seeks to identify key factors influencing youth development, providing a scientific basis for more effective support strategies and interventions that can help immigrant adolescents thrive.

**RESEARCH FOCUS**
* To examine how **parenting styles** relate to **teen stress, mood, sleep**, and **help-seeking behaviors** in immigrant families across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS**
* Identified and researched a **community need**: **teen mental-health stressors** in immigrant families (expectations, language/culture gaps, access to youth-friendly services).
* Collaborated with a team of students and framed a **research question** with **Dr. Tao Wang**.
* Reviewed prior **studies**, analyzed **research constructs and methods**, and developed **ethics-aligned research procedures** (assent/consent, confidentiality, data handling).
* Recruited, scheduled, and interviewed **150+ teen–parent pairs** across the GTA using respectful, structured interviews.
* Led a **data-collection team** and standardized procedures to ensure quality and cultural sensitivity.
* Collaborated with team members to build a **Python workflow** for **data cleaning, labeling, analysis**, and **figure generation**.
* Compiled **datasets** and a **codebook**; contributed figures and summary sections to the team’s manuscript (under review in the *Journal of Minority and Immigrant Health*).
* Prepared and delivered **presentations** summarizing **study purpose, methods, and results** for academic and school audiences.
* Translated **findings** into **practical takeaways** for schools and families (communication tips, routine-building, culturally aware supports).
* Earned a **Learning Dedication Award** for **leadership, persistence**, and continued **growth** in **psychology, sociology**, and the **social sciences**.

**SKILLS DEVELOPED**
* **Literature review** and **research ethics**
* **Qualitative interviewing** and **participant engagement**
* **Python coding, data cleaning, visualization**, and **figure generation**
* **Team coordination** and **project management**
* **Professional communication** and **knowledge translation**

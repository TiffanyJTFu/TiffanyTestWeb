<br>**Project Topic**: <i>**Mental Health AI Chatbot Project**</i>
<br>**Research Mentor**: <i>**Prof. Ganesh Mani (Carnegie Mellon University)**</i>

### Project Background

In such a challenging society where mental health issues are at an all-time high, I watched how stress can turn from a feeling into a lifestyle. Among adolescents, **anxiety** and **burnout** are common—yet access to mental-health care is limited due to **cost**, **stigma**, and social barriers. I began with a focused question: **Can AI chatbots support teen mental health** for those facing cultural stigma, social barriers, or financial limits?

With guidance from **Dr. Ganesh Mani (Carnegie Mellon)**, I analyzed a mixed-methods study comparing human therapists with AI responses to therapeutic communication. I then developed a **four-step method**:

1. **Checklist of counseling moves**: validation, open questions, concrete steps, safety language, referrals
2. **Synthetic teen/adolescent personas** reflecting common stressors: anxiety, family conflict, academic stress, sleep disruption
3. Scripted scenarios and chatbot dialogues
4. Score exchanges against the checklist, noting strengths and failure modes (e.g., minimization, vague advice, missing crisis guidance)

After collecting my data, I will **create a presentation** with data graphs and a **scientific report** including ranked AI model performance and recommended prompts and systems. The project addresses access gaps by identifying AI tools that best approximate supportive communication for youth unable to reach clinicians, while clearly stating limits and emphasizing **crisis-referral pathways**. My goal is to create an **AI prototype chatbot** to augment clinical care and help adolescents access mental health support safely.

### Project Details

* Analyzed AI research methods (qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods); mapped strengths, biases, and threats to validity
* Designed a mixed-methods study under guidance of **Prof. Ganesh Mani**
* Phase I (design/pilots) completed; Phase II (data collection/analysis) in progress
* Built a **4-step evaluation method**: clinician-inspired rubric → synthetic teen personas → standardized scenarios → rubric-based scoring
* Engineered synthetic personas to safely simulate high-risk scenarios
* IRB-eligible, non-human-subjects evaluation of AI support tools
* Structured user profiles with scripted backstories to control variability
* Testing multiple AI systems to identify strengths, weaknesses, and remediation roadmap
* Will deliver scientific report + presentation: ranked model leaderboard, prompt best-practices, data visualizations, deployment guidelines with **crisis pathways**
* Engineering a **crisis-aware AI chatbot** to augment, not replace, clinical mental health care, using safety guardrails from study results

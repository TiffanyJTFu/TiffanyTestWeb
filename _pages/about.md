## Research, Innovation, and AI Chatbot Projects

<a href="https://tiffanyjtfu.github.io/TiffanyFu/teaching/MentalHealthAIChatbotProject" target='_blank'><i>**1. Mental Health AI Chatbot Project 2025**</i></a>
<br>**Project Topic:** Mental Health AI Chatbot Project
<br>**Research Mentor**: **Prof. Ganesh Mani (Carnegie Mellon University)**
* This project investigates how AI chatbots can support teens facing mental health challenges when traditional care is inaccessible. Guided by Dr. Ganesh Mani (Carnegie Mellon), it evaluates various AI systems using a structured checklist and simulated teen scenarios to measure empathy, safety, and effectiveness. The goal is to identify the most supportive AI models and eventually develop a prototype chatbot that offers accessible, stigma-free mental health support for adolescents.<br>

Hi, I’m Tiffany — a dynamic and creative student with a **deep passion** for **cultural expression, community engagement, and social impact**. I’ve trained in **Ballet**, **Classical Chinese Dance**, and **Modern Dance** for **over 13 years**, and I’m currently pursuing certification through the **Arts Unionville Dance Program** at **Unionville High School in Ontario**. I enjoy sharing my cultural heritage through performance, blending tradition with storytelling, and regularly appear at **multicultural festivals** and **community events**.

Beyond the performing arts, I’m actively involved in **non-profit organizations**. I’ve served as both Sponsorship Coordinator and Outreach Executive, where I helped **plan events, coordinated sponsor outreach, managed logistics, and supported day-of execution**. My work included researching and **contacting potential sponsors, developing sponsorship packages, and securing both financial and in-kind contributions to ensure successful events.

At school, I participate in the **Model United Nations (Model UN) Club**, where I’ve represented countries at the Toronto Model UN Conference. These experiences have helped me develop a deeper understanding of global issues, diplomacy, and international relations, while also strengthening my public speaking and negotiation skills.

I’m also an engaged member of the **Mock Trial Club**, where I participate in simulated courtroom trials. I work closely with my peers to prepare case materials, construct legal arguments, and role-play as attorneys and witnesses. These experiences have given me a solid foundation in legal processes, courtroom etiquette, and critical thinking.

Creativity plays a big role in my life beyond academics and performance. I enjoy baking and cooking, and I often contribute to charity bake sales and school fundraisers that support meaningful causes.

Giving back to the community is deeply important to me. I regularly volunteer at local festivals, community events, and organizations that support sick and hospitalized children.

My curiosity and drive for academic growth have led me to pursue research opportunities in social science and psychology. I collaborated with **Dr. Tao Wang, a professor at the University of Toronto**, on a project titled **“Cross-Cultural Education Methods and Adolescents’ Physical and Mental Health.”** My role included conducting literature reviews, assisting with survey design, and supporting data collection and analysis.

**In Summer 2024**, I attended the **Brown University Pre-College Program in Leadership and Social Change**, where I completed an independent **research project** titled **“The Misrepresentation of Chinese Culture: A Youth Perspective on Anti-Asian Racism and Cultural Identity.”** Under the mentorship of a Brown University assistant professor, I explored the effects of cultural disconnect among youth in one of Canada’s most diverse cities and proposed actionable strategies to promote inclusion and cross-cultural understanding.

**In Summer 2025**, I was selected to participate in **Shad York**, a nationally recognized **Shad Canada enrichment program** focused on STEAM, entrepreneurship, and leadership. As part of the program, I co-developed **ICELERT, an innovation prototype** designed to detect and alert drivers to icy road conditions, helping prevent weather-related accidents. I contributed to both the **technical development and the business planning process**.

Additionally, **I played a leading role in organizing and hosting Shad York’s Open Day Celebration and Evening Variety Show. As one of the Masters of Ceremonies (MCs)**, I introduced speakers and performers, engaged the audience, and helped manage the stage to ensure a smooth and memorable event.

I am **deeply passionate about exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and mental health**, particularly through the development of **AI chatbots** that provide accessible emotional support to youth. **Beginning in Summer 2025**, I received the opportunity to work with **Prof. Ganesh Mani (Carnegie Mellon University)** on this project, which perfectly aligns with my interests in **research, innovation, and the ethical application of AI to real-world challenges**. I am continuing to advance this work by building on my research, refining my methods, and expanding its impact. I am eager to contribute my curiosity, analytical skills, and dedication to **developing AI systems that demonstrate technical excellence while fostering empathy, inclusion, and mental well-being**.

My academic interests span **political science, psychology, economics, and law**, reflecting a long-term goal of understanding how human behavior and governance intersect to create meaningful and lasting societal change.

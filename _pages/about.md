Hi, I’m Tiffany — a dynamic student with a passion for research, leadership, and community engagement. I’ve trained in **Ballet, Classical Chinese Dance, and Modern Dance** for **over 13 years** and am currently **pursuing certification** through the **Arts Unionville Dance Program** at **Unionville High School**, Ontario. I enjoy **using my dance skills to contribute to multicultural communities**, blending tradition with storytelling, and performing at multicultural festivals and community events.

Beyond the arts, I actively engage in **leadership roles** within **non-profit organizations**. I have served as Sponsorship Coordinator and Outreach Executive, where I organized events, coordinated sponsor outreach, developed sponsorship packages, and secured financial and in-kind support to ensure successful programming. These experiences strengthened my skills in strategic planning, collaboration, and event management while allowing me to **make a tangible impact on the community**.

At school, I participate in the **Model United Nations Club**, representing countries at the **Toronto Model UN Conference**. These experiences have deepened my understanding of global issues, diplomacy, and negotiation, while **enhancing my public speaking and critical thinking skills**. I am also a member of the **Mock Trial Club**, where I participate in **simulated courtroom trials, construct legal arguments, and role-play as attorneys and witnesses**, building a solid foundation in **legal processes, teamwork, and analytical reasoning**.

I am an active member of the **Dessert Club**, **leading weekly baking sessions and organizing bake sales**. I instruct peers in foundational baking skills and Asian dessert techniques, and have successfully sold nearly 100 cookies per event, **raising funds for school charities and community causes**.

My **research interests** are central to my academic growth. I collaborated with **Dr. Tao Wang (University of Toronto)** on a **project studying “Cross-Cultural Education Methods and Adolescents’ Physical and Mental Health,”** assisting with literature reviews, survey design, and data analysis.

The student **attended the Brown University Pre-College Program in Summer 2024**, enrolling in the **Social Change and Leadership course**. During the program, the student **completed a Community Social Issue Project**, exploring topics related to cultural representation and youth engagement, and proposed actionable strategies to promote inclusion and cross-cultural understanding.

**In Summer 2025**, I was selected for **Shad York**, a **national STEAM and leadership program**, where I **co-developed ICELERT**, a prototype that detects icy road conditions to prevent accidents. I also played a key role in organizing and hosting Shad York’s Open Day Celebration and Evening Variety Show as one of the Masters of Ceremonies, demonstrating leadership, organization, and audience engagement skills.

**Currently**, I am working on the **Mental Health AI Chatbot Project** under **Prof. Ganesh Mani (Carnegie Mellon University)**. This project explores whether accessible AI chatbots can credibly support adolescents facing mental health challenges due to social, cultural, or financial barriers. I am contributing to designing, testing, and evaluating AI solutions to provide empathetic and accessible mental health support for youth.

My **academic interests** span **political science, psychology, economics, and law**, with a long-term goal of understanding how human behavior and governance intersect to drive meaningful societal change. Through dance, research, and leadership, I aim to **create impact, foster inclusion, and contribute to communities in tangible ways**.

I am enrolled in the **elite, selective 4-year audition-based Arts Unionville Dance Program** at **Unionville High School**, a rigorous, conservatory-style program providing advanced training in **contemporary, jazz, hip hop, and stage performance**. This program has been instrumental in **enhancing my favorite hobby and special skills—dance**— helping me develop strong **technical ability, musicality, artistic expression, and confident stage presence**.

Throughout my time in the program, I have performed in numerous **school productions** such as Dance Highlights, Alchemy, and the annual December showcases, consistently applying precision, energy, and expressive intention from warm-up to curtain call. These experiences have strengthened my understanding of performance dynamics, ensemble coordination, and the ability to communicate emotion and storytelling through movement.

In addition to performing, I have explored **choreography and leadership** by creating original dance pieces for assignments and shows, coaching peers on timing, counts, and cues, and leading warm-ups and cooldowns. Collaborating closely with lighting, costume, and technical teams has further deepened my appreciation for the full scope of production work and creative collaboration.

Beyond school performances, I am passionate about **using my dance skills to contribute to community and multicultural events**, performing pieces that celebrate cultural diversity and foster connection across different audiences. Engaging with these events has shown me the power of dance as a medium for **cultural storytelling, dialogue, and shared human experience**.

Through the Arts Unionville Dance Program, I have also **developed essential artistic and personal skills**, including kinaesthetic awareness, partnering techniques, stamina, discipline, and creative expression. The program has been a central part of my high school experience, nurturing not only my growth as a dancer but also my commitment to **sharing my skills and passion to make a positive impact in my community**.

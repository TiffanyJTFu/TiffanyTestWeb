As part of the **Arts Unionville Dance Program** at **Unionville High School**, I’ve had the opportunity to train in a conservatory-style environment that emphasizes both **technical excellence and creative expression**. Through advanced study in **contemporary, jazz, hip hop, and stage performance**, I’ve developed a strong foundation in movement, musicality, and performance artistry.
**
Each year, I’ve performed in major productions such as Dance Highlights, Alchemy, and the annual December showcases. These experiences have taught me how to connect storytelling with movement, maintain discipline through long rehearsal processes, and work collaboratively within a team of dancers and artists.

Beyond performing, I’ve also explored **choreography and leadership** — creating original works for assignments and showcases, leading warm-ups and cooldowns, and helping coach peers to achieve consistency and confidence on stage. Collaborating with lighting and costume designers has given me a deeper appreciation for how all elements of production come together to bring a creative vision to life.

Being part of the **Arts Unionville community** has shaped not only my growth as a dancer but also my development as a communicator, collaborator, and storyteller. Dance has become a way for me to express emotion, connect across cultures, and continually challenge myself as both an artist and a learner.

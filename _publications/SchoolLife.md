Throughout my school life, I have pursued a **well-rounded and purpose-driven path** marked by **academic curiosity, artistic passion**, and meaningful **community engagement**. I have consistently excelled in my studies while actively participating in enrichment programs such as the **Shad Canada Program (Summer 2025)** and the **Brown University Pre-College course in Leadership and Social Change (Summer 2024)**, where I completed a **Community Social Issue Project** exploring strategies to promote inclusion and cross-cultural understanding.

**In Summer 2024**, I also joined the **Cross-Cultural Education Methods and Adolescents’ Physical and Mental Health Project** under **Dr. Tao Wang** at the **University of Toronto**. I contributed to all stages of research, including literature review, interviewing 150+ teen–parent pairs, Python-based data cleaning and analysis, team coordination, and translating findings into actionable recommendations for schools and families. I earned a **Learning Dedication Award** for leadership, persistence, and growth in social sciences.

As a dedicated student in the **Arts Unionville Dance Program**, I have trained for **over 13 years in Ballet, Classical Chinese Dance, and Modern Dance**. I use performance to celebrate cultural heritage and promote multicultural understanding at community events and festivals. I am **passionate** about enhancing and **sharing my dance skills to contribute to my community**, regularly participating in shows, choreography, and workshops that blend artistic expression with social engagement.

Beyond the arts, I am actively involved in **Model United Nations, Mock Trial Club**, and various student-led initiatives. I have taken on leadership roles in **non-profit organizations** such as **Ignite Fair** and **United Speakers Global**, contributing to event planning, sponsorship coordination, and outreach.

I am also an active member of my school’s **Dessert Club**, where I am the most experienced baker in weekly sessions, learning foundational and Asian dessert-specific techniques. I **organize bake sales**, selling nearly 100 items to **support school fundraisers and charity causes**.

My **academic interests** span **political science**, **psychology**, **economics**, and **law**, reflecting my passion for understanding **societal challenges** and making a positive impact through **informed leadership**, **civic engagement**, and **community service**. I continue to pursue research opportunities, including my ongoing **Mental Health AI Chatbot Project** under **Prof. Ganesh Mani (Carnegie Mellon University)**, exploring accessible AI-based support for adolescent mental health.
